Power BI DAX Function Practice

This project demonstrates how to use core DAX functions in Power BI to analyze sales data effectively. It includes practical examples using common DAX operations like COUNT, SUM, IF, and date-based functions, along with the creation of custom measures and quick measures.

1. COUNT Functions  
Explore multiple ways to count data in a Power BI model  
1.1 COUNT: Counts non-blank values  
1.2 COUNTROWS: Counts rows in a table or filtered table  
1.3 DISTINCTCOUNT: Counts the number of unique values such as distinct orders  

Use case: Counting the number of sales orders using different DAX count methods

2. SUM and Profit Calculation  
Understand how to aggregate numeric data using SUM and create custom profit calculations  
2.1 Basic SUM of columns like Selling Cost and Product Cost  
2.2 Using Quick Measure and New Measure to compute  
- Total profit across all orders  
- Profit per order using the formula  
  Profit = (Selling Price - Product Cost) * Quantity  

3. Date-Based Analysis  
Use DAX date functions to extract insights over time  
3.1 Identify which month has the highest number of orders  
3.2 Analyze data by week using the WEEKDAY function  

Use case: Identify seasonal trends or peak sales days

4. IF Function for Conditional Logic  
Use IF statements to classify data based on custom conditions  
4.1 Categorize orders as Big Order or Small Order based on quantity or profit threshold  

5. Summary  
This project demonstrates  
5.1 Writing basic and intermediate DAX expressions  
5.2 Understanding the difference between New Measures and New Columns  
5.3 Using Quick Measures in Power BI for simplified calculations  
5.4 Applying date intelligence to real-world business scenarios  

6. Files Included  
6.1 Power BI pbix report file  
6.2 Sample dataset if applicable  
6.3 DAX formulas and calculated columns and measures  

7. Getting Started  
7.1 Open the pbix file in Power BI Desktop  
7.2 Review each measure and column under the Model or Data view  
7.3 Explore visuals to see how DAX functions drive insights
